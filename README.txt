This is the code for paper ‘DEEPGONET: Multi-label prediction of go annotation for 
protein from sequence using cascaded convolutional and recurrent network’. https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCITECHN.2018.8631921


In this project we developed cascaded convolutional network to predict top level hierarchy
of GO annotation of protien from it's primary sequence .

The GO annotation for protein has three aspects.
Biological Process(BP),
Molecular Function(MF),
Cellular Function (CC).

We build three models for predicting top level hierarchy of BP, MF, CC for proteins.

We used experimentally validated annotation( BP, MF, CC) of Homo sapiens.

We have tested our models in different organisms.
